[WeBWorK](https://github.com/openwebwork) Installation Script(s)
===============================================================

This repository consists of a perl script `ww_install.pl`, along with some supporting bash scripts, 
config files, and perl modules designed to work together install the open source online homework system 
[WeBWorK](https://github.com/openwebwork).

The script has been updated to install WeBWorK 2.10 as of 12/22/2014.

It has been tested and supported on 
*  Debian Wheezy
*  Fedora 20
*  Ubuntu 14.04
*  CentOS 7

On these systems it did install webwork. 

Gotchas
-------

-  There is currently no package in Fedora 21 which provides the pnmtops program.  The installer will fail when checking for required modules and programs.  Once [this](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1171903) bug is fixed the installer '''should''' work.  

Usage
-------

To install [WeBWorK](https://github.com/openwebwork):

1. Get the `install_webwork.sh` script:

  `wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/aubreyja/ww_install/master/install_webwork.sh`
  
  or if you prefer
  
  `curl -ksSO https://raw.github.com/aubreyja/ww_install/master/install_webwork.sh`

2. As root (or with sudo) do

  `bash install_webwork.sh`

Note that if you use sudo, then you must be a sudoer with sufficient administrative rights 
(probably `ALL=(ALL) ALL`) for `install_webwork.sh` to work properly. If not, run this command as root.

For more control over the process you can clone this repository with

`git clone https://github.com/aubreyja/ww_install.git`

and then run the scripts individually as needed.

Contents
--------

### install_webwork.sh

This script is the 'controller' that ties together the other scripts.  It opens an install log, downloads this
repo and opens it in (typically) `/tmp`.  Then it runs `install_prerequisites.sh` followed by `ww_install.pl`.
When `ww_install.pl` exits, it attempts to open webwork in the system's default web browser, copies 
webwork_install.log to your top level webwork directory (e.g. `/opt/webwork`) and then deletes the downloaded installation package.

### bin/install_prerequisites.sh

If your system does not have all of the prerequisites installed, then the `install_prerequisites.sh` script 
might help.  The goal of that script is to install all of the software that WeBWorK depends on. This is also
the script most likely to be incomplete or fail in some way on your system.  For systems based on Debian 
(Ubuntu,etc.) and Red Hat (CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc.) it will do everything needed. We're working 
on getting it to install prereqs on other systems such as OpenSUSE and Magia, but for now other systems will 
need to have these prerequisites already installed.  If you would like to fill it out for your favorite 
linux distro or unix system, I will happily accept pull requests.

### bin/ww_install.pl

The goal of `ww_install.pl` is to install WeBWorK on any system on which the prerequisites are already installed.  

It is an interactive script based on the core perl module [Term::UI](http://perldoc.perl.org/Term/UI.html), and is written with the goal of being cross-platform.  It does use some linux built-ins, and work is needed to ensure that this script will work as well on unix machines. Again, contributions of work in this direction would be welcome.

### Other files

The `extra/` subdirectory contains scripts which help with optional post install tasks.  These are not currently 
hooked into the other scripts, so you'll need to run them separately.  Currently contains

* `iptables_rules.sh` 

  Sets up an iptables firewall which only allows network services necessary for running WeBWorK.

* `generate_ssl_cert.sh`

  Steps user through generating an ssl cert.  Under construction.

* `install_chromatic.pl`

  Standalone script to compile `pg/lib/chromatic/color.c` so the NAU library graph theory problems work. This
  functionality has been incorporated into `ww_install.pl`, so it should not be necessary to run this script. However,
  if you find the NAU graph theory problems are complaining that `pg/lib/chromatic/color` doesn't exist, then you 
  can run this script to compile it for you.

The `lib/` subdirectory contains copies of any perl modules the script uses but which don't need to be installed 
on your system for webwork to run.

The `conf/` subdirectory contains copies of config files or snippets of config files that this installation package
will ask to modify.

The `deb/` subdirectory contains work (in progress) toward creating a 
debian archive for installing webwork.

The `rpms/` subdirectory is Mark Hamrick's work toward creating a webwork
rpm (as a submodule, so I can easily get a hold if it when/if I eventually
start looking at it).

If you use the script, please email me to let me know what OS you installed it on so I can add a notation to
the list of tested distributions above and address any problems you run into. I'd also be happy to hear 
suggestions for improvement.
